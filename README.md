Components
------------

## Fortigate Device Tracker
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.1.3-green.svg" />

If enabled, Fortigate unit tracks the status and gathers different information about the devices connected to your network. This component grabs this information via Fortigate's API requests.

Device inventory is available at  `User & Device -> Device inventory`:

Firewall shows if devices are online or offline based on a configured timeout. This timeout defaults to 5 minutes, but it could be changed through CLI:

```
config system global
set device-idle-timeout 300
end
```

Fortigate's API returns a LAST_SEEN value instead of the device status (Online or Offline), so timeout values configured at HASS level are applied. If you want the information to be consistent across systems, it's recommended to set *device-idle-timeout* and *consider_home* parameters with same values.


### Requisites

 - Tested on FortiOS 6.0.4 and Home Assistant >= 0.90.2 (Tested on 0.98.2)
 - Device discovery enabled on the Fortigate at interface level

### Installation

- Copy "fortigate_tracker" folder to your `<config dir>/custom_components/fortigate_tracker` directory.
- Configure as shown below.
- Restart HASS.

### Configuration

Add the following to your `configuration.yaml`.

```yaml
# Fortigate DeviceTracker
device_tracker:
  - platform: fortigate
    host: HOST
    port: HTTPS_PORT
    username: !secret FG_USERNAME
    password: !secret FG_PASSWORD
    consider_home: 300
    interval_seconds: 120
    timeout: 120
    
```

Vars:

| Var | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **host** | IP Address / Host name of Fortigate's management interface. |
| **port** | (*Optional*)  HTTPs service port (443 by default). |
| **username** | Username for API access. |
| **password** | Password for API access. |
| **consider_home** | (*Optional*) Timeout to set the device as "away" after the configured timeout. |
| **interval_seconds** | (*Optional*) Time between discovery request to Fotigate's API. |
| **timeout** | (*Optional*) Time to detect the device as offline, in seconds (Defaults to 60). |

### Supported devices

This component currently supports:

- Bat
- Thermic
- Motion
- Door
- Pod
- Siren

### Important Info

Since Hass 0.96, the way climate devices work has been changed and it is NOT backward compatible. Default (included) climate.py works for HASS versions >= 0.96, but a file called climate.py_pre_096 is available (but not mantained) for use if you are using HASS between 0.92 and 0.96. Just make a backup of climate.py and rename climate.py_pre_096 to climate.py

### Requisites

 - Client ID and Secret for Wattio Platform (Request to wattio Support)
 - Works on Home Assistant >= 0.90.2 (Tested on 0.98.2)

### Installation

- Copy "wattio" folder to your `<config dir>/custom_components/wattio` directory.
- Configure as shown below.
- Restart HASS.
- Follow the adittional configuration steps.

### Configuration

Add the following to your `configuration.yaml`.

> From version 0.2.0 the way of Wattio component is configured has been changed. If you are upgrading for a previous version you **MUST CHANGE YOUR CONFIG FILE**

```yaml
# Wattio Platform
wattio:
    scan_interval: 60
    security: true
    security_interval: 300
```

Vars:

| Var | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *scan_interval* | OPTIONAL - Time (in seconds) between data updates , defaults to 30 seconds |
| *security* | OPTIONAL - Enable or disable security devices, defaults to False |
| *security_interval* | OPTIONAL - Time (in seconds) between security devices data updates, defaults to *scan_interval* |


### Adittional steps

 - At first launch a new notification is shown at the UI requesting the user to configure de user id and the secret. 
 - The configuration file "wattio.conf" is created automatically.
 - Change user id and secret in "wattio-conf".

   > User id and secret MUST be supplied by wattio team (This is not your user and password!)

 - After changing the configuration file, another notification should appear asking the user to authorize home assistant at wattio.
 - Follow the link for authorization, a page requesting username and password from Wattio should be shown.
 - Finally, close the notification and refresh your GUI.
 - Once devices has been added to HASS, first data update will take place after the configured scan_interval.
